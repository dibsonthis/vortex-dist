A self contained repository for Vortex programs. It includes everything you will need to run Vortex programs in one simple environment:

- The Vortex interpreter
- Vortex standard library modules
- Vortex config file
- Basic source directory scaffold
- A run script to launch your application

If you wish to make changes to the scaffolded directory, make sure to update the config file to point to the correct entry point.

To run the program, simply call `./run` in the root directory. This will launch the intepreter with the provided entry point.

<b>This repository contains executable files (the Vortex interpreter and modules). They are provided pre-compiled as a convenience, and there's no need to compile anything yourself. Simply clone the repository and start writing.</b>
